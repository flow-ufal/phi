3,,"In statistics, a confidence interval (CI) is a type of interval estimate of a statistical parameter. It is an observed interval (i.e., it is calculated from the observations), in principle different from sample to sample, that frequently includes the value of an unobservable parameter of interest if the experiment is repeated. How frequently the observed interval contains the parameter is determined by the confidence level or confidence coefficient.",Confidence Interval,,Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval,/api/v1/aggregationstatistic/confidenceInterval/,confidenceInterval,1527,Current
