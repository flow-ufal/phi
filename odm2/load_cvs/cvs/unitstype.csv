0,Radiology,Gray (Gy),"Absorbed dose (also known as Total Ionizing Dose, TID) is a measure of the energy deposited in a medium by ionizing radiation. It is equal to the energy deposited per unit mass of medium, and so has the unit J/kg, which is given the special name Gray (Gy). Note that the absorbed dose is not a good indicator of the likely biological effect. 1 Gy of alpha radiation would be much more biologically damaging than 1 Gy of photon radiation for example. Appropriate weighting factors can be applied reflecting the different relative biological effects to find the equivalent dose. The risk of stoctic effects due to radiation exposure can be quantified using the effective dose, which is a weighted average of the equivalent dose to each organ depending upon its radiosensitivity.

6,Mechanics,Joule Second (J s),"Quantity of rotational motion. Linear momentum is the quantity obtained by multiplying the mass of a body by its linear velocity. Angular momentum is the quantity obtained by multiplying the moment of inertia of a body by its angular velocity. The momentum of a system of particles is given by the sum of the momenta of the individual particles which make up the system or by the product of the total mass of the system and the velocity of the center of gravity of the system. The momentum of a continuous medium is given by the integral of the velocity over the mass of the medium or by the product of the total mass of the medium and the velocity of the center of gravity of the medium. In physics, the angular momentum of an object rotating about some reference point is the measure of the extent to which the object will continue to rotate about that point unless acted upon by an external torque. In particular, if a point mass rotates about an axis, then the angular momentum with respect to a point on the axis is related to the mass of the object, the velocity and the distance of the mass to the axis.

When current flows, however, the voltage across the terminals of the source of emf is no longer the open-circuit value, due to voltage drops inside the device due to its internal resistance.

171,Mechanics,Newton meter (N-m),"In physics, a torque (?) is a vector that measures the tendency of a force to rotate an object about some axis [1]. The magnitude of a torque is defined as force times its lever arm [2]. Just as a force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist. The SI unit for torque is newton meters (N m). In U.S. customary units, it is measured in foot pounds (ft lbf) (also known as 'pounds feet'). Mathematically, the torque on a particle (which has the position r in some reference frame) can be defined as the cross product: ? = r x F where r is the particle's position vector relative to the fulcrum F is the force acting on the particles, or, more generally, torque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum, ? = dL/dt where L is the angular momentum vector t stands for time.",0,-2.0,0,0.0,2,L2M1T-2,0.0,1,Torque,Has the same dimensionality as energy/work,QUDT,http://qudt.org/vocab/quantity#Torque,/api/v1/unitstype/torque/,torque,1340,Current
172,Chemistry,Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU),"Turbidity is the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid, or of air, caused by individual particles (suspended solids) that are generally invisible to the naked eye, similar to smoke in air. Turbidity in open water is often caused by phytoplankton and the measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality. The higher the turbidity, the higher the risk of the drinkers developing gastrointestinal diseases, especially for immune-compromised people, because contaminants like virus or bacteria can become attached to the suspended solid. The suspended solids interfere with water disinfection with chlorine because the particles act as shields for the virus and bacteria. Similarly suspended solids can protect bacteria from UV sterilisation of water. Fluids can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many different sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the settleable solids), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are colloidal. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid.",0,0.0,1,0.0,0,U1,0.0,0,Turbidity,,QUDT,http://qudt.org/vocab/quantity#Turbidity,/api/v1/unitstype/turbidity/,turbidity,1341,Current

When the stored energy increases, so does the length of the molecular bonds. As a result, solids typically expand in response to heating and contract on cooling; this dimensional response to temperature change is expressed by its coefficient of thermal expansion. Different coefficients of thermal expansion can be defined for a substance depending on whether the expansion is measured by: * linear thermal expansion * area thermal expansion * volumetric thermal expansion These characteristics are closely related. The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient can be defined for both liquids and solids. The linear thermal expansion can only be defined for solids, and is common in engineering applications. Some substances expand when cooled, such as freezing water, so they have negative thermal expansion coefficients.",-1,0.0,0,0.0,3,L3?-1,0.0,0,Volume thermal expansion,,QUDT,http://qudt.org/vocab/quantity#Volumethermalexpansion,/api/v1/unitstype/volumeThermalExpansion/,volumeThermalExpansion,1343,Current
